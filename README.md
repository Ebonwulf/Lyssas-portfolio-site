# Portfolio remake using React

After learning React I decided to try and remake my portfolio site that I made at the start of my training using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I have used routing and Link to navigate through the different pages.

I created reusable components to prevent repeated code, unlike my original portfolio where there was lots of repetition in the HTML.
I have really enjoyed remaking my portfolio site and I feel that this one is so much better!
